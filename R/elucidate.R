#' "elucidate: a collection of convenience functions to help researchers elucidate patterns in their data."
#'
#' "This package provides a collection of convenience functions to facilitate
#' exploratory data analysis by researchers. While many of the functions are
#' geared towards data analysis tasks typical in the behavioural and health
#' sciences (e.g. analysis of numerical variables between experimental groups),
#' they are more widely applicable. The package has also been designed with the
#' goal of making common analytical processes in R more accessible to (data)
#' science trainees by providing a consistent API for data analysis and
#' visualization. Note This package is currently in development and its
#' functionality will be improved over time."
