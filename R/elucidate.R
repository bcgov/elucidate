#' "elucidate: a collection of convenience functions to help researchers elucidate patterns in their data."
#'
#' "This package provides a collection of convenience functions to facilitate
#' data analysis by researchers. While many of the functions are geared towards
#' data analysis tasks typical in the behavioural and health sciences (e.g.
#' analysis of numerical variables between experimental groups), they are more
#' widely applicable. The package has also been designed with the goal of making
#' common analytical processes in R more accessible to (data) science trainees
#' by providing a consistent API for data analysis and visualization. Note This
#' package is currently in development and its functionality will be improved
#' over time."
