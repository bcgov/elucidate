## Project Status

This package is currently maintained by [Craig Hutton](https://craig.rbind.io/), a Data Scientist working with the Research Branch of the [British Columbia Ministry of Social Development & Poverty Reduction](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/social-development-poverty-reduction).

## Why `elucidate`?

`elucidate` provides a collection of convenience functions to make exploratory data analysis in R easier and more accessible to researchers:

* Functions that help summarize data of multiple types (numeric, character strings, logicals, etc.) using descriptive statistics (`describe*`) split by any number of grouping variables with comparable performance to existing alternatives and enhanced customization via arguments.

* Functions that make it easier to access the power of the [boot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/index.html) package to obtain confidence intervals for a variety of summary statistics (`*_ci`), with options for within-group calculations and parallelized computation to maximize performance.

* Functions that help you visualize your data using the popular [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) & [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) packages more easily via a relatively simple API with sensible and well documented arguments rather than layers (`plot_*`). 

* Miscellaneous functions that fill in a few of the (rare) gaps in `R`'s statistical computing & data science toolkit, e.g. functions which are easy for experienced users to write on the fly but are challenging for `R` novices or researchers without programming experience to implement: the standard error of the mean (`se()`), an operator that returns the values that do not match a vector (`%ni%`, i.e. the opposite of `%in%`), the mode of a vector (`mode()`), etc.

Inspired by tidyverse naming conventions, the core functions of `elucidate` are organized into sets that begin with a common root (e.g. `describe*`, `plot_*`), since this enables the user to see them all as suggestions as you are coding in R studio.

Drawing from similar inspiration, many elucidate functions are also designed to accept a data object as the 1st argument and to return a data or plotting object (e.g. ggplot2 or plotly) so they are compatible with the pipe operator from the [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html) package for easy integration into data processing pipelines. For convenience, the pipe operator is also imported when elucidate is loaded.

The `static_to_dynamic()` function converts a data frame into an interactive [datatable](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) or [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/cookbook/cookbook.html) depending on sample size or preference. `static_to_dynamic()` also converts ggplot2 objects (including `plot_*` outputs) into interactive [plotly](https://plotly-r.com/) graphs.


## Installation

You can install the development version of elucidate from this repository with:

``` r
# use the remotes package to install from a github repository

install.packages("remotes") #only run this 1st if you haven't installed remotes before

remotes::install_github("bcgov/elucidate")
``` 

The authors of `elucidate` acknowledge and express their gratitude to the authors of the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table), and the functions of other dependency packages which were used to build `elucidate`, since without their effort and ingenuity `elucidate` would mostly have remained a collection of ideas instead of functions. 

## Usage

Use `describe()` to describe a single variable in a data frame of vector of values:

```{r describe, cache = TRUE}
library(elucidate)

#using a vector as input
describe(data = rnorm(1:1000, 100, 5))

#using a data frame and specifying a variable in that data frame

describe(data = pdata, y = y1) #no grouping variables, numeric input class 

describe(pdata, g) #factor input class 

describe(pdata, even) #logical input class 

pdata %>% describe(high_low) #character input class, data piped in

describe(pdata, d) #date input class 

#obtain within-group summaries by adding grouping variables

describe(pdata, y1, high_low, g) #two grouping variables
```

To describe all variables in a data frame, use `describe_all()`:

```{r describe_all, cache = TRUE}

#if more than one class of variable is summarized you'll get a list
#if only one class is present in the data, or only one is requested, you'll get a dataframe

describe_all(pdata) #all summary types in a list, not split by any grouping variables

#only want summaries of certain variable classes? No problem, use the class argument: 

#numeric summary only, split by a grouping variable
pdata %>% 
  describe_all(high_low, 
               output = "dt", #you can ask for a tibble or data.table as output options
               class = "n") 

```

Calculate confidence intervals for a sample mean, median or other summary statistic using `describe_ci()` & `describe_ci_all()`:

```{r describe_ci, cache = TRUE}

#confidence intervals for the mean are calculated (by default) using a
#theoretical normal distribution...
pdata[1:100, ] %>% describe_ci(y1, stat = mean)

#confidence intervals for other statistics are obtained using bootstrapping
pdata[1:100, ] %>% 
  describe_ci(y1, stat = median) #bootstrapped median

pdata[1:100, ] %>% 
  describe_ci(y1, stat = sd) #bootstrapped standard deviation

#describe_ci_all will return CIs for all numeric variables in a data frame

describe_ci_all(pdata[1:1000, ], stat = median) #bootstrapped CIs for the median

describe_ci_all(pdata, high_low, stat = mean) #mean CI split by a grouping variable

```


Use the `plot_*` set of functions to easily obtain ggplot2 or plotly visualizations:

```{r plot, cache = TRUE}
data(mtcars)

#basic histogram
plot_histogram(mtcars, x = mpg)

#customized density plot
mtcars %>% plot_density(x = mpg,
                        colour_var = cyl, #assign a variable to colour
                        colour_var_order = c("6", "8", "4"), #reorder the levels of the colour variable
                        colour_var_labs = c("six" = "6", "eight" = "8"), #recode the colour variable labels
                        colour_var_values = c("blue3", "red3", "green3"), #change the colours from the ggplot2 defaults
                        colour_var_title = "# cylinders")


#boxplot showing additional customization
plot_box(data = mtcars, #data source
         x = cyl, #variable on the x-axis
         y = hp, #variable to go on the y-axis
         xlab = "# of cylinders", #custom x-axis label
         ylab = "horsepower", #custom y-axis label
         fill_var = am, #assign variable am to fill
         fill_var_order = c("0", "1"), 
         fill_var_title = "transmission", #relabel the fill variable title in the legend
         fill_var_labs = c("manual" = "0", "automatic" = "1"), #recode the fill variable labels
         fill_var_values = c("blue", "red"), #change the colours from the ggplot2 defaults
         theme = "bw") #specify the theme

#violin plot with quantiles added
mtcars %>% plot_violin(y = mpg, x = cyl, 
                       fill = "blue", 
                       draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))

#scatterplot with a polynomial regression line that can be added by specifying a
#model formula
mtcars %>%
  plot_scatter(y = mpg, x = hp,
               regression_line = T, 
               regression_method = "lm", 
               regression_se = T,
               regression_formula = y ~ poly(x, 2))


#plot a mean with SE error bars

mtcars %>% 
  plot_stat_error(y = mpg, x = cyl, alpha = 0.6,
                  stat = "mean", error = "se")

#notice that the y-axis default reflects the specified statistic (mean or
#median) and error metric

#You can also produce a bar graph of group medians with 95% bootstrapped
#confidence interval error bars and easily modify fill, colour, and transparency
mtcars %>% 
  plot_stat_error(y = mpg, x = cyl,
                  stat = "median", 
                  fill = "blue2",
                  colour = "black",
                  alpha = 0.7, 
                  replicates = 5000) #controls the number of bootstrapped samples to use


#an example with longitudinal data

library(gapminder) #import the gapminder dataset from the gapminder package

gapminder %>%
   plot_stat_error(y = lifeExp, x = year, 
                   stat = "mean", error = "se", #mean +/- standard error, default error metric is a 95% CI
                   colour_var = continent, 
                   geom = "point", #either "bar" or "point". default = "point"
                   p_size = 2, #adjust the size of the points
                   add_lines = T, #connect the points with lines. This is useful for repeated-measures data.
                   alpha = 0.6) #adjusts the transparency

```
