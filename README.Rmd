## Project Status

[![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Maturing-007EC6)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

This package is currently maintained by [Craig Hutton](https://craig.rbind.io/), a Data Scientist working with the Research Branch of the [British Columbia Ministry of Social Development & Poverty Reduction](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/social-development-poverty-reduction).

## Why `elucidate`?

`elucidate` provides a collection of convenience functions to make exploratory data analysis in R easier and more accessible for researchers to:

  * Interrogate data in search of row duplications and anomalous values with `dupes()`, `copies()`, and the `counts*` set of functions.

  * Describe data with the `describe*` set of functions for obtaining summary statistics, bootstrapping confidence intervals, and detecting missing values.

  * Quickly visualise and interact with data representations with `static_to_dynamic()` and the `plot_*` set of functions.

Inspired by tidyverse naming conventions, the core functions of `elucidate` are organized into sets that begin with a common root (e.g. `describe*`, `plot_*`), since this enables the user to see them all as suggestions as you are coding in R studio.

Drawing from similar inspiration, many elucidate functions are also designed to accept a data object as the 1st argument and return a data or plotting object (e.g. ggplot2 or plotly) so they are compatible with the pipe operator from the [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html) package for easy integration into data processing pipelines. For convenience, the pipe operator (`%>%`) is also imported from `magrittr` when `elucidate` is loaded.


## Installation

You can install the development version of elucidate from this repository with:

``` r
# use the remotes package to install from a github repository

install.packages("remotes") #only run this 1st if you haven't installed remotes before

remotes::install_github("bcgov/elucidate")
``` 

The authors of `elucidate` acknowledge and express their gratitude to the authors of the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table), and the functions of other dependency packages which were used to build `elucidate`, since without their effort and ingenuity `elucidate` would mostly have remained a collection of ideas instead of functions. 

## Usage

`copies()` can tell you how many rows are duplicated based on one or more variables (default is all of them). To return duplicated rows only we can set the filter argument to "dupes". To sort the results by the number of copies that are detected we can set the "sort_by_copies" argument to `TRUE`.

```{r copies, cache = TRUE}
library(elucidate)

#list any number of variables to use when searching for duplicates after the
#data argument
copies(pdata,
       d, #in this case we search for duplicated based on the "d" (date) column
       filter = "dupes",#return duplicated rows only
       sort_by_copies = TRUE) 

```

Since this is by far the most common way of using `copies()`, version 0.0.0.9023 of `elucidate` also introduced a convenience wrapper called `dupes()` for the above:

```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE}
copies_result <- copies(pdata, d, filter = "dupes", sort_by_copies = TRUE)
dupes_result <- dupes(pdata, d)

identical(copies_result, dupes_result)
```

Use `describe()` to describe a single variable in a data frame or a vector of values:

```{r describe, cache = TRUE}
#using a numeric vector as input
describe(data = rnorm(1:1000, 100, 5))

```

To describe all variables in a data frame, use `describe_all()`:

```{r describe_all, cache = TRUE}
#if more than one class of variable is summarized you'll get a list
#if only one class is present in the data, or only one is requested, you'll get a dataframe

describe_all(pdata,
             #you can ask for a "tibble" or "dt" (data.table) as output options
             #default is currently "tibble", as in the previous example.
             output = "dt") 

```


Only want to summarise certain variable classes? No problem, use the "class" argument.

Would you like a description for each level of a grouping variable? Just provide the unquoted name of the column to use for splitting.

```{r describe_all grouped, cache = TRUE}

pdata %>% 
  describe_all(g, #get a description for each level of the "g" column
               class = "n") #describe numeric columns only

```

Use the `plot_*` set of functions to easily generate customized ggplot2 visualisations:

```{r plot, cache = TRUE}
data(mtcars)

#customized density plot
mtcars %>% plot_density(x = mpg,
                        colour_var = cyl, #assign a variable to colour
                        colour_var_order = c("6", "8", "4"), #reorder the levels of the colour variable
                        colour_var_labs = c("six" = "6", "eight" = "8"), #recode the colour variable labels
                        colour_var_values = c("blue3", "red3", "green3"), #change the colours from the ggplot2 defaults
                        colour_var_title = "# cylinders")

#plot group means with SE error bars
mtcars %>% 
  plot_stat_error(y = mpg, x = cyl,
                  stat = "mean", error = "se",
                  alpha = 0.6, fill = "blue2")

```

These examples only highlight a few of the many things `elucidate` can do. **Check out [this blog post](https://craig.rbind.io/post/2020-12-07-asgr-3-0-exploring-data-with-elucidate/) for a comprehensive guide.**
