This package is currently maintained by [Craig Hutton](https://craig.rbind.io/), a Data Scientist working with the Research Branch of the [British Columbia Ministry of Social Development & Poverty Reduction](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/social-development-poverty-reduction).

## Why `elucidate`?

`elucidate` provides a collection of convenience functions to make exploratory data analysis in R easier and more accessible for researchers to (among other things):

  * Interrogate data in search of row duplicates with `dupes()` and anomalous values with the `counts*` set of functions.
  
  * Describe data with the `describe*` set of functions for obtaining summary statistics, bootstrapping confidence intervals, and detecting missing values.

  * Quickly visualise and interact with data representations with the `plot_*` set of functions.

Inspired by tidyverse naming conventions, the core functions of `elucidate` are organized into sets that begin with a common root (e.g. `describe*`, `plot_*`), since this enables the user to see them all as suggestions as you are coding in R studio.

Drawing from similar inspiration, many `elucidate` functions are also designed to accept a data object as the 1st argument and return a data or plotting object (e.g. ggplot2 or plotly) so they are compatible with the pipe operator from the [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html) package for easy integration into data processing pipelines.

For a comprehensive introduction to the package see the vignette via `vignette("elucidate")`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of elucidate from this repository with:

``` r
# use the remotes package to install from a github repository

install.packages("remotes") #only run this 1st if you haven't installed remotes before

remotes::install_github("bcgov/elucidate")
``` 

The authors of `elucidate` acknowledge and express their gratitude to the authors of the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table), and the functions of other dependency packages which were used to build `elucidate`, since without their effort and ingenuity `elucidate` would mostly have remained a collection of ideas instead of functions. 


## Usage

`dupes()` can tell you how many rows are duplicated based on one or more variables (default is all of them). 

```{r copies, cache = TRUE}
library(elucidate)

#list any number of variables to use when searching for duplicates after the
#data argument
dupes(pdata, d) 
#in this case we search for duplicated based on the "d" (date) column        

```

`describe()` a single variable in a data frame or a vector of values.

```{r describe, cache = TRUE}
#set random generator seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1234)

#using a numeric vector as input
describe(data = rnorm(1:1000, 100, 5))

```

`describe_all()` all variables in a data frame. 

```{r describe_all grouped, cache = TRUE}
describe_all(pdata)
```

Use `plot_var()` to produce a class-appropriate [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) graph of a single variable in a data frame or a vector of values. 

```{r plot_var, cache = TRUE}
plot_var(data = rnorm(1:1000, 100, 5)) 
#in this case we get a density plot with a normal density curve added for
#reference (dashed line).
```

To generate class-appropriate `ggplot2` graphs for all variables in a data frame and combine them into a multiple-panel figure with the [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html) package, use `plot_var_all()`. You can also limit the graphing to a subset of columns with the "cols" argument, which accepts a character vector of column names.

```{r plot_var_all, cache = TRUE}
plot_var_all(pdata, cols = c("y1", "y2", "g", "even"))
#density plots for numeric variables and bar graphs for categorical variables
```
## Learn more

These examples only highlight a few of the many things `elucidate` can do. You can learn more from these additional resources: 

 * A **[blog post](https://craig.rbind.io/post/2020-12-07-asgr-3-0-exploring-data-with-elucidate/)**, which was written to help researchers and science trainees learn how to use the package for common exploratory data analysis tasks.
 
 * The **introductory vignette** (`vignette("elucidate")`), which provides annotated code examples that demonstrate most of the package's functionality.
